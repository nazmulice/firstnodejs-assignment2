    <h1>Summer</h1>
    <p>
      The Bengali year begins with summer. This occurs from the equivalent of
      mid-April to mid-June, when the weather is hot and dry with the occasional
      violent storm. Monsoon season traditionally spreads from mid-June to
      mid-August, and brings with it up to 85% of the year's total rainfall.
