    <h1>Winter</h1>
    <p>
      Mid-December to mid-February brings winter, the coolest and perhaps most
      pleasant season in Bangladesh, with average temperatures of 11-20 C
      (52- 68ÂºF). Finally, spring takes place from mid-February to mid-April,
      when warm breezes pick up and periodic thunderstorms punctuate the
      afternoons.
